# Reinforcement Learning for a Virtual Lunar Lander

This project was completed as a part of the Honors portion of the [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning) Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Credit to DeepLearning.AI, Stanford, and the Coursera platform for providing the course materials and guidance.

## Objective

The primary objective of the final graded practice lab in this course is to develop a codebase for a virtual lunar lander. Through this project, I will have the opportunity to apply and reinforce the concepts of deep reinforcement learning that have been covered in the lectures. Upon completing the lab, I will be able to view a video of the lunar lander in action and assess whether it has acquired the necessary skills to achieve a successful landing on the moon's surface. This hands-on experience aims to enhance my understanding of reinforcement learning and its practical application in simulated lunar landing scenarios.
